title: Use Slicing in Numpy Array
explanation: >
  Each dimension index can be not only number or tuple, but a slice expression similar
  to how you use it in native python lists. 
  The syntax is `start:end:step`'.
  So if you want to choose only the first 3 element in the second row you can use the 
  expression: `matrix[1, :3]`'.

  Note: The `end` is not included in the selection.

cols: 7
